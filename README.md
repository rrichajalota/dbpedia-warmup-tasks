### Access QA system via API
**About:** This is a telegram bot which accesses the QA system of WolframAlpha. <br>
To run this bot, a telegram account would be required. Make a new bot by sending the message "/newbot" to @BotFather on telegram. Store the token received in a secrets.py file (in the same directory where question_answering_bot.py is stored). This token will be used to access the Telegram Bot API.  

Now, to access WolframApha's API, get registered on the site and request for a new APP_ID. Store the APP_ID in the secrets.py file where bot's token was saved. 

Finally, run the script as: python question_answering_bot.py from the terminal.

#### Dependencies to be installed:
* requests
* urllib

#### Example Snippet
